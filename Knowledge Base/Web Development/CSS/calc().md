# calc()

Primarily used for calculating dimensions like width, height, and margins

```css
selector {
    width: calc(100% / 3);
    height: calc((100vh + 300px) / 2);
}
```

Take note that the `+` and `-` operators have to be surrounded by white space, but `*` and `/` do not. However, it's usually a good idea to keep your formatting consistent, so we'd recommend you surround all of them with white space.
