# Dealing with tokens

How to retrieve and verify tokens, as well as how to protect routes from unauthorized users.

## Getting the Token from the Header

Inside our application, authorization works like middleware. If a valid token is presented, the request will continue on for further processing. Otherwise, the request will go to a controller which will return an error message to the client.

Let's create a folder called `middleware`, and inside of this, we'll put a file called `auth.js` where we'll write the code for the authorization request.

We'll need to get the token from the header. First, let's deal with the error handler for cases when there's no token inside the header:

```jsx
// middleware/auth.js

module.exports = (req, res, next) => {
  // getting authorization from the header
  const { authorization } = req.headers;

  // let's check the header exists and starts with 'Bearer '
  if (!authorization || !authorization.startsWith('Bearer ')) {
    return res
      .status(401)
      .send({ message: 'Authorization required' });
  }
};
```

If the token is where it should be, we'll need to extract it from `authorization`. To do this, we'll call the `replace()` method in order to remove the `'Bearer '` prefix.

```jsx
// middleware/auth.js

module.exports = (req, res, next) => {
  const { authorization } = req.headers;

  if (!authorization || !authorization.startsWith('Bearer ')) {
    return res
      .status(401)
      .send({ message: 'Authorization required' });
  }

  // getting the token
  const token = authorization.replace('Bearer ', '');
};
```

By doing this, only the JWT will be in the `token` constant that we created.

## Token Verification

After extracting the token from the request, we must make sure that the user has actually sent the token that was earlier given to that user. For this, we can use the `verify()` method that the `jsonwebtoken` module provides. This method takes two arguments: the token, and a secret key which the token was signed with:

```jsx
// middleware/auth.js

const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

module.exports = (req, res, next) => {
  const { authorization } = req.headers;

  if (!authorization || !authorization.startsWith('Bearer ')) {
    return res
      .status(401)
      .send({ message: 'Authorization required' });
  }

  const token = authorization.replace('Bearer ', '');

  // verifying the token
  const payload = jwt.verify(token, 'some-secret-key');
};
```

If the token and secret key are valid, the `jwt.verify()` method returns the decoded payload of this token. If something goes wrong with the token, an error will be returned. In order to process this, we'll need to move the `jwt.verify()` method inside of a `try...catch` block.

```jsx
// middlewares/auth.js

const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

module.exports = (req, res, next) => {
  const { authorization } = req.headers;

  if (!authorization || !authorization.startsWith('Bearer ')) {
    return res
      .status(401)
      .send({ message: 'Authorization required' });
  }

  const token = authorization.replace('Bearer ', '');
  let payload;
  
  try {
    // trying to verify the token
    payload = jwt.verify(token, 'some-secret-key');
  } catch (err) {
    // we return an error if something goes wrong
    return res
      .status(401)
      .send({ message: 'Authorization required' });
  }
};
```

Since `let` and `const` are block scoped, we can't declare our `payload` variable inside of `try`, as it won't be visible from outside this block. For this reason, we'll initialize our variable before the `try` block using the keyword `let`, and we'll assign a value here later, inside the curly braces of the `try` block itself.

## Writing the Payload to the Request

The token was verified and the payload was received. Now we will add the payload to the `req.user` property. This will ensure that the next middleware can see for whom this request was executed:

```jsx
// middleware/auth.js

const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

module.exports = (req, res, next) => {
  const { authorization } = req.headers;

  if (!authorization || !authorization.startsWith('Bearer ')) {
    return res
      .status(401)
      .send({ message: 'Authorization Required' });
  }

  const token = authorization.replace('Bearer ', '');
  let payload;
  
  try {
    payload = jwt.verify(token, 'some-secret-key');
  } catch (err) {
    return res
      .status(401)
      .send({ message: 'Authorization Required' });
  }

  req.user = payload; // assigning the payload to the request object

  next(); // sending the request to the next middleware
};
```

## Protecting Routes

The authorization middleware is ready. Let's apply it. One of our options is to add the middleware to the entire application:

```jsx
// app.js

const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const { createUser, login } = require('./controllers/auth');
const auth = require('./middleware/auth');

const app = express();

// some routes don't require auth
// for example, register and login
app.post('/signup', createUser);
app.post('/signin', login);

// authorization
app.use(auth);

// these routes need auth
app.use('/cards', require('./routes/cards'));
```

Another option is to add middleware for a separate route. In this case, you pass the middleware as the second argument inside the request handler:

```jsx
// first we'll call 'auth' and then,
// if the auth is successful, 'createCard'

app.post('/cards', auth, createCard);
```

## Getting the User Object

The way we wrote our middleware makes it so that upon successful authorization an object consisting of the payload will be saved to the `user` property of the request object:

```jsx
// controllers/cards.js

module.exports.createCard = (req, res) => Card.create({
  name: req.body.name,
  link: req.body.link,
  owner: req.user._id // employing req.user in a handler
});
```
