# User Creation

### Creating a User Model

```jsx
// models/user.js

const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  email: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true
  },
  password: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    minlength: 8
  }
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('user', userSchema);
```

Caution

If you add `unique: true` to a field, but your collection already contains duplicates, the new constraint won't work. Deleting the offending data should resolve the issue. A similar problem can arise if you add `required: true` to a field and have documents in your collections that don't have that field.

### Saving Users in the Database

We set up a user in the database by making a server request. To accomplish this, we've created a controller called `createUser`. Inside the controller, we get the `email` and `password` from the request, then we write them to the database:

```jsx
// controllers/users.js

const User = require('../models/user');

exports.createUser = (req, res) => User.create({
  email: req.body.email,
  password: req.body.password,
})
  .then((user) => res.send(user))
  .catch((err) => res.status(400).send(err));
```

If a user with the same `email` already exists in the database, the `catch()` block will activate and the user's information will not be saved to the database. Usually, it's best to reserve `catch()` statements for unexpected errors, but as it's just an example, let's not worry about that for now.

## Hashing Passwords

In order to hash a password, we'll need to use a module called `bcryptjs`. As with other modules, we'll need to install it, then import it inside the project.

We're adding the code to hash the passwords to the user creation controller. The `hash()` method is responsible for this process:

```jsx
// controllers/users.js

const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs'); // importing bcrypt
const User = require('../models/user');

exports.createUser = (req, res) => {
  // hashing the password
  bcrypt.hash(req.body.password, 10)
    .then(hash => User.create({
      email: req.body.email,
      password: hash, // adding the hash to the database
    }))
    .then((user) => res.send(user))
    .catch((err) => res.status(400).send(err));
};
```

This method accepts two parameters: a password, and a number. This number will be the length of our "salt," which is a random string the method adds to the password before hashing is performed.
