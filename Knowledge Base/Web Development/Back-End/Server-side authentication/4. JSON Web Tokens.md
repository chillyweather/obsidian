# JSON Web Tokens

## The Structure of a Token

A token is a collection of characters, generated and structured according to a certain set of rules. This structure and these rules are defined by a token creation standard. We'll use the JWT (JSON Web Token) standard.

JWT is based on standard JSON. A token created according to this standard consists of three parts, each containing specialized information:

-   The "header" contains some meta-information about the token.
-   The "payload" consists of the data that the token carries.
-   The "signature", which ensures that the information in the token cannot be changed.

### Header

The header contains two fields:

-   The creation algorithm, usually `HMAC` `SHA256` or `RSA`.
-   The type of token, in this case, the string `"JWT"`.

```jsx
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

The resulting JSON object is encoded into a string using the Base64URL algorithm, and this is the first part of the token.

### Payload

The payload contains the actual information which was encoded. In our case, this is some user information:

```jsx
{
  "name": "Jimmy Lao",
  "_id": "39dow8ak8402jf23u4do057s"
}
```

### Signature

The signature guarantees that the contents of the header and payload have not been changed after the creation of the token. A specialized algorithm generates the signature from the contents of the header and the payload. Additionally, this algorithm uses a secret key which is known only to the server.

## Token Creation in Practice

In order to create tokens, we'll make use of the `jsonwebtoken` package. We'll need to import it inside of our project:

```jsx
// controllers/users.js

const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken'); // importing the jsonwebtoken module
```

Afterwards, we can call the `jwt.sign()` method to create a token:

```jsx
// controllers/users.js

const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken'); 

module.exports.login = (req, res) => {
  const { email, password } = req.body;

  return User.findUserByCredentials(email, password)
    .then((user) => {
      // we're creating a token
      const token = jwt.sign({ _id: user._id }, 'some-secret-key');

      // we return the token
      res.send({ token });
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      res
        .status(401)
        .send({ message: err.message });
    });
};
```

We pass two arguments to the `sign()` method: the token's payload and the secret key for the signature.

The `sign()` method also has an optional third parameter, an options object. You can check out the full list of options available with this object inside the official `jsonwebtoken` documentation. We're really only interested in one of these options, `expiresIn`. This is a length of time that specifies how long a token will be valid. We can pass a number here, which the `sign()` method will recognize as a number of seconds:

```jsx
const token = jwt.sign(
  { _id: user._id },
  'some-secret-key',
  { expiresIn: 3600 } // this token will expire an hour after creation
;
```

```jsx
expiresIn: '120ms' // 120 miliseconds
expiresIn: '15m' // 15 minutes
expiresIn: '2h' // 2 hours
expiresIn: '7d' // 7 days
```
