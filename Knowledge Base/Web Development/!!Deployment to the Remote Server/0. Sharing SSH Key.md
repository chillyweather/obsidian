## Adding an SSH with the help of `ssh-copy-id`

`ssh-copy-id` is a small utility that exists with the sole purpose of registering a key on a remote server. You can use it to add a key like this:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i <path-to-the-key>/your-new-key.pub <username>@<ip_of_your_server>
```

But this utility has a flaw: to add a new key to the server, you need to connect to the server using the key that's already been added to it. If this is your first key, use the second option and add it manually.
