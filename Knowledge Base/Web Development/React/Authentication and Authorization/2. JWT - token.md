# JSON Web Token

A token created according to this standard consists of three parts, each containing specialized information:

-   The `header` contains metadata about the token.
-   The `payload` consists of the data that the token carries.
-   The `signature` ensures that the information in the token cannot be changed.

### Header
Contains two fields:

-   The creation algorithm: usually HMAC, SHA256 or RSA.
-   The type of token, in this case, the string `"JWT"`.

```jsx
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

The resulting JSON object is encoded into a string using the Base64URL algorithm, and this makes up the first part of the token.

### Payload
```jsx
{
  "name": "Elise Bouer",
  "_id": "39dow8ak8402jf23u4do057s"
}
```
As with the header, the payload is encoded in a string, and this encoded string is the second part of the token.

### Signature
The signature guarantees that the contents of the header and payload have not been changed since the token was created, which is important from a security perspective. A specialized algorithm generates the signature from the contents of the header and the payload. Additionally, the algorithm uses a secret key which is known only to the server.
