Inside the command line, we will navigate to the directory where we'd like to create our project. Once there, we'll simply input the following command: `npx create-react-app calorie-zen`. 

This will install CRA and create a project folder named `calorie-zen`. 

Each time we want to make a new project, we can simply run `npx create-react-app` followed by the name of our project, which is `calorie-zen` in this case.

Navigate to the proper directory by using this command: `cd calorie-zen`.

Now that we're in the proper directory, it's finally time to run the project. In order to do that, inside the `calorie-zen` directory, we'll just need to run one more command: `npm start`.

After doing this, the project should automatically open, but if it doesn't, we can simply navigate our browser to this address: `http://localhost:3000/`.
