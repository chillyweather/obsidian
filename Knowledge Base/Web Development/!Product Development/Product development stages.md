# Product development stages

1. Product idea -> ** terms of reference (TOR)**(A formal document that describes the purpose and structures of a project, roles and responsibilities of people involved, and expectations of the result.)

2. Solution -> How to do it -> Rough prototypes
3. Design
4. Implementation
5. Testing and debugging
6. Publication (Deployment)
7. Refactor (optionally)



When you're analyzing the design specifications for a webpage, look out for the following:

1.  How does the number of rows and columns change when elements are compressed?
2.  Do elements change their order relative to one another?
3.  How do the dimensions and margins of elements change? Try to identify patterns or think of some rules that can be applied.
4.  What elements appear or disappear depending on the screen size?
5.  How do items respond to changes in the styles of their containers? For example, the `row` value of the `flex-direction` property is often replaced with the `column` value to bring positioned elements back into the flow.
