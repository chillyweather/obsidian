###### **1. Syntax Error**

As the name suggests, a syntax error is one where something is wrong with the syntax. Most of the time, this means that you've forgotten to put a semicolon at the end of a line, or that there's a bracket missing somewhere.

###### **2. Reference Error**

You'll get a reference error if you refer to an undeclared variable or call a non-existent function.

###### **3. Type Error**

A type error appears when a variable is not a valid type. For example, say we assigned a value to our variable and then tried referring to that name as a function.
