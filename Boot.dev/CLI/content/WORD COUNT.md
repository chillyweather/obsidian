# WORD COUNT

```bash
wc file.txt
```

The wc utility displays the number of lines, words, and bytes contained in each input file, or standard input (if no file is specified) to the standard output.

# HELP

By convention, most production-ready CLI tools have a "help" option that will print out some information about how to use the tool. It's usually accessed with one of the following:

- `--help` (flag)
- `-h` (flag)
- `help` (first positional argument)

The "help" output is often easier to parse than a full `man` page. It's usually more of a quick start guide than a full manual.
