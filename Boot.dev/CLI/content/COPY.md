# COPY

The [copy command](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=c-cp-command) does what you would (hopefully) expect: it copies a file from one location to another.

```bash
cp source_file.txt destination/
```

You can also copy a directory and all of its contents recursively by adding the `-R` flag:

```bash
cp -R my_dir new_dir
```
