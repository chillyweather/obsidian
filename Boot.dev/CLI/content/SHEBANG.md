# SHEBANG

A ["shebang"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) is a special line at the top of a script that tells your shell which program to use to execute the file.

The format of a shebang is:

```bash
#! interpreter [optional-arg]
```

For example, if your script is a Python script and you want to use Python 3, your shebang might look like this:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/python3
```

This tells the system to use Python 3 located at `/usr/bin/python3` to run the script.
