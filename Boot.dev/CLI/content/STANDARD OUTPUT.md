# STANDARD OUTPUT

You might not even know it yet, but you're already a pro at using standard output. You've been using it since you started the first exercise in this course.

["Standard Output"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_output_%28stdout%29), usually called "standard out" or "stdout", is the default place where programs print their output. It's just a stream of data that prints to your terminal, but we'll talk later about how it can be redirected to other places.

All programming languages have a simple way to print to stdout. In Python, it's the `print` function:

```py
print("Hello world")
# Hello world
```

In a shell, it's the `echo` command:

```bash
echo "Hello world"
# Hello world
```
