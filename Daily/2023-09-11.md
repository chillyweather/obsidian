Hello, My name is Dmitry. I work at a company specializing in creating design systems. My responsibilities include developing plugins and widgets for Figma, as well as working on various integrations between Figma, Storybook, or any other API.

I believe that my skill set aligns very well with the requirements of this position.

Most of my code is stored in private repositories, as it is intended for internal use only. However, I would be more than happy to showcase my projects in person.

Sincerely, Dmitry
