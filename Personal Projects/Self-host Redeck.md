Certainly! I'll provide you with step-by-step instructions to self-host Readeck on your Linode server. Here's how you can do it:

## Preparation

1. Log in to your Linode server via SSH.

2. Update your system:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## Installing Docker

3. Install Docker if it's not already installed:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

4. Add your user to the docker group:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

5. Log out and log back in for the group changes to take effect.

## Setting up Readeck

6. Create a directory for Readeck:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/readeck
cd ~/readeck
```

7. Create a Docker Compose file:
```bash
nano docker-compose.yml
```

8. Add the following content to the file:
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  readeck:
    image: codeberg.org/readeck/readeck:latest
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/readeck
    restart: unless-stopped
```

9. Save and exit the editor (in nano, press Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).

## Launching Readeck

10. Start Readeck using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Accessing Readeck

11. Readeck should now be running on your Linode server. You can access it by navigating to:
```
http://your_linode_ip:8000
```

Replace `your_linode_ip` with your Linode server's IP address.

## Additional Security (Optional)

12. For added security, you may want to set up a reverse proxy (like Nginx) and obtain an SSL certificate (using Let's Encrypt) to enable HTTPS access.

## Upgrading Readeck

13. To upgrade Readeck in the future, run:
```bash
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

Remember, Readeck consists of a single executable file with no dependencies, making it relatively lightweight to run[2]. The Docker container approach provides an easy way to manage and update the application.

Make sure to regularly back up the `~/readeck/data` directory, as it contains your database and bookmark files[2].
