- [ ] Plugin for exchanging components:
	- [ ] Choose stack
		- [x] Should i go React?
		- [x] Or Create Figma Plugin as usual?
	- [ ] Make basic interface
		- [ ] Try to use some external component library, like ShadeCN (nah, too complicated)
	- [ ] Reach needed component through Rest api
	- [ ] Generate thumbnail for element  
	- [ ] Drag in functionality (probably impossible)
	- [ ] Drag out functionality








1. Keeps library of added components outside of figma.
2. Some way to share component (it's copy, actually) with other users.
3. Should keep styles / variables, but if they are not on the receiving side - parse to pixels and rgb
4. Inner instances inside of shared component, as i see it now - should be saved together with shared component.
